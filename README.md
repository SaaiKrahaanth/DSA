# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my **DSA repository**, where I am actively working on solving problems and mastering various Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository is updated regularly with solutions, notes, and implementations to improve my coding skills and prepare for competitive programming and job placements.

## 1. Overview

This repository focuses on building a strong foundation in:
- Core Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- Algorithmic Techniques (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, etc.)
- Problem-Solving on platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and **HackerRank**.

My goal is to refine my understanding of these concepts, solve a wide range of problems, and optimize for time and space complexities.

## 2. Topics Covered

Here is a list of topics being covered in this repository:

- **Arrays**: Basics, Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Subarrays
- **Strings**: Palindromes, Pattern Matching, String Manipulation
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, Doubly, Circular, Reversal Problems
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation, Applications, Parentheses Problems
- **Trees**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Traversals, Heaps
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, Shortest Paths, MST, Topological Sort
- **Recursion and Backtracking**: Subsets, Permutations, N-Queens
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack, LCS, LIS, Matrix Chain Multiplication
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Activity Selection, Huffman Encoding
- **Sorting and Searching**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search Variants

## 3. Code Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
DSA/
├── Arrays/
│   ├── Problem1_SlidingWindow.py
│   └── Problem2_TwoPointers.java
├── Strings/
│   ├── Problem1_PalindromeCheck.py
│   └── Problem2_KMPAlgorithm.cpp
├── Trees/
│   ├── Problem1_BinaryTreeTraversal.java
│   └── Problem2_LCA.cpp
├── DynamicProgramming/
│   ├── Problem1_Knapsack.py
│   └── Problem2_LCS.java
└── README.md
```

Each folder contains:
- **Problems** with detailed explanations in comments.
- Solutions in multiple programming languages when possible.
